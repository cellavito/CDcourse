This course is about continuous delivery, or CD, with GitHub Actions. CD is a crucial part of modern software development, and it can have a monumental impact on development projects. 

Continuous Delivery is the practice of delivering software faster and with higher quality. Doing so successfully requires many different practices, behaviors, and technologies. GitHub Actions makes implementing CD easier, faster, and more reliable.

In this course, we focus on using workflows in GitHub Actions to deploy pull requests automatically to a staging environment, and to deploy all merged commits to production using Microsoft Azure.

**Please note**: You may need a credit card to create an account with Azure. If you're a student, you may also be able to take advantage of the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) for access to Azure. If you'd like to continue with the course without an Azure account, Learning Lab will still respond, but none of the deployments will work.

## What you'll learn

We'll answer common questions like:
- What is Continuous Delivery?
- What is a workflow file and how are workflows used with GitHub Actions?
- What are deployment triggers and how are they used with deployments?
- How can secrets store tokens?


And when you're done you'll be able to:
- Use GitHub Actions and create workflow files
- Use secrets to store tokens
- Deploy to staging and production using GitHub Actions to implement CD


## What you'll build
In this course, we'll be walking through a CD deployment using GitHub Actions, and creating a Tic Tac Toe game!
